        <h3>Frontend Developer!</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Hi! I'm Shrawan Thakur, a frontend developer currently pursuring my degree in Bsc.CS(Bachlors of science in computer science) at Sharda university, I have a strong passion for web development and Iam actively building my skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript.
         While studying, I've worked on various projects, including <span><a href="https://boking.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Booking site</a>, <a href="https://charitey.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Charitee site</a>, <a href="https://contractform.netlify.app" target="_blank">Simple form</a>, <a href="https://football-gmatch.netlify.app" target="_blank">Football site</a>, <a href="https://tactoegame.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Simple game</a></span></p>
        <h1>Journey and Inspiration</h1>
        <p>My journey to becoming a frontend developer started with a fascination for how websites could make ideas come alive on the screen. Growing up, I was captivated by the way design and functionality worked hand-in-hand, making complex information accessible and interactive. The idea that I could build something that people would see and use drove me to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and soon enough, I was spending countless hours tinkering with code, transforming ideas into fully-functional sites. Over the years, I’ve refined my skills and dived into various frameworks and libraries, steadily expanding my toolkit and honing my style as a frontend developer.</p>

        <h1>Core Values</h1>
        <p>At the heart of my work is a commitment to user-centered design. I believe a website should do more than just look good – it should serve the user’s needs intuitively. Clean, efficient code is also incredibly important to me; well-organized code not only makes maintenance easier but is a sign of respect for my craft and anyone else who might work with it. Creativity is another value I hold dear, as it allows me to bring fresh, innovative ideas to each project, giving users a memorable experience.</p>
 
        <h1>Fun Facts</h1>
        <p>When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring photography or working on side projects, always looking to bring new perspectives into my work. I love experimenting with visual storytelling, both in my coding projects and through the lens, finding unique angles to capture a story. Fun fact: I’ve also been learning to play the guitar – it's a different kind of challenge that keeps my creativity flowing outside the screen!.</p>
